    <div class="about-me">
      <p>I was born and raised in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. <em>Naturally</em>,
        I love the beach, and I first discovered my love for photography while taking
        photos of the beautiful Florida coastline. As a teenager I attended Dreyfoos
        School of the Arts, where I studied digital media. It was at Dreyfoos that I
        began to explore artistic portraiture. It was also in high school that I began
        working as a wedding photographer, and I was instantly hooked. Beyond just
        taking photos, I loved the opportunity to get know so many different people
        and help capture their dream day. Since starting my journey as a wedding
        photographer, my work has been featured in a number of magazines including
        The Knot. I have also held numerous workshops for budding photographers and
        been been a guest teacher in workshops around the country. I feel so blessed
        to be doing what I love every day! </p>
