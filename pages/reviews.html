      <p>“I <strong>LOVED</strong> working with Stella! My husband and I had an
        intimate destination wedding and only invited a couple of guests.
        I have to say, not only was I thrilled with Stella’s work, I loved
        getting to know her as a person and I was so glad to have her at my
        wedding! We became instant friends.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="review-2">
      <p>“Stella is the best person to call for all of your photography needs!
        I have 5 rambunctious children, and somehow Stella managed to keep them
        all posed and happy for our family portrait session. I could not thank
        her enough.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="review-3">
      <p>“What impressed me the most about Stella’s work was her editing.
        Each photo was edited to perfection, with stray hairs removed, eyes
        brightened, and a beautiful tone that fit the mood of my autumn
        portraits. Thank you Stella!”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="review-4">
      <p>“Stella made our engagement shoot so fun and easy! My fiancé hates
        getting his photo taken, but her easy going personality put us both
        at ease and she was able to get some great shots of us! I appreciated
        her knowledge of good poses, and her ability to capture genuine candid
        moments. I will cherish these photos forever!” </p>
